			Screen Memories are a Freudian concept, referring to trivial memories which lay on top of and thereby efface other, more formative and potentially traumatic ones, leading to false recollections or even the suppression of past events. Yet this term could also be read differently - screen memories as memories of screens, or by means of screens. 
			<br> <br>
			This two channel video installation investigates the role of screens (also including window-, projection- or movie screens) in processes of remembering, forgetting and missing. Multiple narratives surrounding themes of loss, Greek mythology, language history and cinema are interwoven to depict both personal as well as collective forms of screen memories, and their potential to both destabilise and create new meaning.

			Screen Memories are a Freudian concept, referring to trivial memories which lay on top of and thereby efface other, more formative and potentially traumatic ones, leading to false recollections or even the suppression of past events. Yet this term could also be read differently - screen memories as memories of screens, or by means of screens.
			<br> <br>
			This two channel video installation investigates the role of these screens (which aren’t limited to just phones or other electronic devices, but can also include window- or projection screens) in processes of remembering, forgetting and missing. The plot is vaguely centred around a person trying to remember an undefined relationship with somebody who is now gone, but also includes other interwoven narratives and storylines which themselves overlay and occlude each other.
			<br> <br>
			In an ideal display setting, two screens of the animation face each other at a 180° angle, forcing the viewer to look back and forth between the two. They thereby relate to each other not only thematically, but often also spatially, since they sometimes depict two angles or sides of the same scene. For instance, a shot of the view from the back of a car driving away from a beach is shown on one screen, while the other shows the rearview mirror of the front of the car, as if the screen were literally, physically mirroring the events on the other. In another scene, a shadow puppet appears to act out a retelling of the greek myth of Butades and Kora of Sicyon, showing the puppet on one screen and the corresponding shadow it casts on the other. 
			<br> <br>
			This myth ends up being central to the whole of the story and summarises the animation’s overarching themes of loss, memory and the screen as a tool of both recollection and effacement: Kora falls in love with a man who has to leave her for a long journey, yet before they depart, she draws the outline of his shadow which is cast on a wall. This tracing of the shadow acts as a sort of proto-photographic process, in which light and shadow are being captured in a way that allows for lasting memory, but which also distorts. This is made even more clear in the animation, as while in the myth Butades then casts the outline of the shadow in clay, thereby creating the first known clay relief, here he is unable to do so because Kora’s lover’s shadow keeps moving, eluding her grip.
			<br> <br>
			This is then connected to the video’s whole mode of animation, which makes use of both CGI as well as rotoscoping. The latter is a technique in which individual frames of existing video material are being redrawn one by one, creating the effect of hand drawn animation with an overly realistic, uncanny feel. Over 1200 of these frames were created by hand by using an old monitor to draw over existing movie footage, such as the intro of Paramount Pictures as well as a sequence from the 1978 soviet adaptation of Anton Chekhov's novel The Shooting Party, “A Hunting Accident”. A direct connection between this act of capturing frames from a screen and Kora’s act of tracing a shadow is being established. Other videos, which are turned into animation by way of rotoscoping, include handheld footage from phone cameras uploaded to YouTube, implicating our current use of screens in order to capture and maintain memories as well. </p>
