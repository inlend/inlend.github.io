			Screen Memories are a Freudian concept, referring to trivial memories which lay on top of and thereby efface other, more formative and potentially traumatic ones, leading to false recollections or even the suppression of past events. Yet this term could also be read differently - screen memories as memories of screens, or by means of screens. 
			<br> <br>
			This two channel video installation investigates the role of screens (also including window-, projection- or movie screens) in processes of remembering, forgetting and missing. Multiple narratives surrounding themes of loss, Greek mythology, language history and cinema are interwoven to depict both personal as well as collective forms of screen memories, and their potential to both destabilise and create new meaning.

			Screen Memories are a Freudian concept, referring to trivial memories which lay on top of and thereby efface other, more formative and potentially traumatic ones, leading to false recollections or even the suppression of past events. Yet this term could also be read differently - screen memories as memories of screens, or by means of screens.

			This two channel video installation investigates the role of these screens (which aren’t limited to just phones or other electronic devices, but can also include window- or projection screens) in processes of remembering, forgetting and missing. The plot is vaguely centred around a person trying to remember an undefined relationship with somebody who is now gone, but also includes other interwoven narratives and storylines which themselves overlay and occlude each other.
			<br> <br>
			In an ideal display setting, two screens of the animation face each other at a 180° angle, forcing the viewer to look back and forth between the two. They thereby relate to each other not only thematically, but also spatially, since they often depict two angles or sides of the same scene. In another scene, a shadow puppet appears to act out a retelling of the greek myth of Butades and Kora of Sicyon, showing the puppet on one screen and the corresponding shadow it casts on the other. This myth ends up being central to the whole of the story and summarises the animation’s overarching themes of loss, memory and the screen as a tool of both recollection and effacement: Kora falls in love with a man who has to leave her for a long journey, yet before they depart, she draws the outline of his shadow which is cast on a wall. This tracing of the shadow acts as a sort of proto-photographic process, in which light and shadow are being captured in a way that allows for lasting memory, but which also distorts. This is made even more clear in the animation, as while in the myth Butades then casts the outline of the shadow in clay, thereby creating the first known clay relief, here he is unable to do so because Kora’s lover’s shadow keeps moving, eluding her grip.
			<br> <br>
			This is connected to the video’s whole mode of animation, which makes use of both CGI as well as rotoscoping. The latter is a technique in which individual frames of existing video material are being redrawn one by one, creating the effect of hand drawn animation with an overly realistic, uncanny feel. Over 1200 of these frames were created by hand by using an old monitor to draw over existing movie footage, such as the intro of Paramount Pictures as well as a sequence from the 1978 soviet adaptation of Anton Chekhov's novel The Shooting Party, “A Hunting Accident”. A direct connection between this act of capturing frames from a screen and Kora’s act of tracing a shadow is being established. Other videos, which are turned into animation by way of rotoscoping, include handheld footage from phone cameras uploaded to YouTube, implicating our current use of screens in order to capture and maintain memories as well. 
			<br> <br>
			At the same time, text overlays that appear throughout the animation open up a further narrative that guides the viewer through the meaning of the english idiom of ‘keeping someone at bay’. The bay first appears as the location of the memory of the video’s protagonist, making use of the romantic connotations of the bay as a place of both fantastical escapism as well as isolation. As the animation progresses, we are being cued in on the idea of the bay as a stylistic device representing a state of denial or of pushing someone away - the colloquial meaning of keeping somebody at bay. In a final twist, the text on screen reveals to us that etymologically, this saying is unrelated to the bay as a geographic location, but instead come from the act of hunting, where ‘bay’ actually derives from the Old French ‘bayer’, which means to bark and refers to the way hunting dogs keep their prey at bay by barking until the hunter shoots the animal. The way in which language history hides this really rather brutal imagery in our everyday language is itself meant to represent a sort of screen memory, in which an innocent image (the bay) is used to suppress something much darker (facing off an animal before being shot). This reference to the act of hunting is then picked up again in the reference to “A Hunting Accident”, in which a young woman is murdered under the guise of it being an accidental shooting while hunting.
			<br><br>
			As a whole, the video thereby turns into a meditation on the way in which these screens, ultimately defined as any surface which can both protect, mediate and efface, are used to create overlaying memories which can pose the risk of distorting or forgetting, but thereby also create new meaning.
